# Dribbble uploads meta-data

I scraped a bunch of meta-data about Dribbble uploads. Maybe you're intrigued by that? Maybe you want to go hunting for the first occurrence of 'flat design' or the last of 'skeuomorphism'? Please do.

## The Data

I've pulled down every upload as-far-as-I-can-tell from the site's very first through the end of August 2013. If it feels incomplete to you, let me know. Or complete it yourself, and merge the data in.

The meta-data I've scraped includes: `dribbble_shot_id`, `created_on`, `title`, `tags`, `likes_count`, `views_count`, `comments_count`.

## Contribute

I've made a [brief and incomplete attempt to analyse this data](http://www.henryandclover.com/2013/10/02/some-design-trend-data/), but I'm no statistician or big-data-cruncher, so I'd appreciate it others had a go.
